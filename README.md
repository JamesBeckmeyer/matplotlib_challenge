Analysis:

1. Capomulin within our timepoints shows greatest promise by having lowest mean, median and SEM of tumor volume.

2. Capomulin regimen may take some timepoints to slow tumor growth and decrease tumor size, and tumor volume may increase later, potentially idicating the cancer developing resistance to treatment. Further testing with longer timepoints advised.

3. Weight and average tumor volume show a correlation. Further analysis should be completed on tumor mass as a pct of body mass.
